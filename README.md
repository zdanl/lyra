The Lyra cryptocurrency launchpad presents a secure and open-source platform, enabling users to capitalize on crypto investments through engagement in impactful tech projects, akin to NFT marketplaces. Beyond leveraging IPFS and smart contracts, Lyra incorporates a meticulously organized implementation of DB documents and custodial wallets generated by serverless functions. The platform offers the option of supporting IPFS hosting for project-related images and metadata. Notably, the configuration allows a seamless transition to fully decentralized funding by deactivating custodial wallets. Authentication, accounts, crypto funds, and project management are seamlessly executed using the pre-designed Backend and NextJS SDK of Appwrite. The system relies on Web 3.0 non-custodial wallets such as Metamask, or external transactions from users' phones or centralized exchanges (CEX) to facilitate server-side funding. While direct cryptocurrency purchases are not currently facilitated on the platform, approval for Transak On-Ramp integration has been secured, allowing users to effortlessly acquire cryptocurrency via credit card with a single click. The platform offers optional and self-hosted KYC, coupled with the additional security measure of two-factor authentication (2FA).
