The Lyra cryptocurrency launchpad is a secure open source platform allowing you to profit from crypto
investments by your users in meaningful tech projects, Similiar to NFT marketplaces. Other than IPFS and
smart contracts, Lyra comes with conventional but well sorted out implementation of DB documents and 
custodial wallets generated by serverless functions. There might be support for IPFS hosting of images
and metadata containing the projects, as well, the platform configuration allows to switch to fully decentralized
funding by turning off custodial wallets entirely. We implement authentication and accounts, crypto funds, and
project management with the predesigned Backend and NextJS SDK of Appwrite, and rely on Web 3.0
non-custodial wallets like Metamask or external transactions from users phones or CEX to fund the server-side.
It is currently not possible to buy cryptocurrency on the platform,
but we have already been approved for Transak On-Ramp integration in the past though allowing your users to 
purchase cryptocurrency via credit card with a single click. KYC is optional and self-hosted. There is 2FA.
